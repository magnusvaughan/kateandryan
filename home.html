      <h5>Welcome to our Wedding Website!</h5>
      <p>We have chosen to have our wedding at the lovely Orchard campsite. We wanted our wedding to be a weekend of fun with lots of friends and family. Another advantage is you can <strong>bring your own alcohol!</strong></p>

<h5>Date</h5>
<p>Saturday 2nd August, 2014</p>

<h5>Time</h5>
<p>1.00pm arrival, for 2.00pm ceremony</p>

<h5>Venue</h5>
<p>The Orchard Campsite<br>
28 Spring Lane, Wickham Market</br>Suffolk, IP13 0SJ<br>

<h5>Attire </h5>
<p>Dress up, dress down, we don’t mind – just so long as you’re there! We have a gorgeous tipi which the celebrations will be held in, but much of the wedding will be an outside affair, so we would suggest bringing something warm for the evening and not wearing very high heels.</p>

<h5>Booze and food</h5>
<p>Food will be served about 5.00pm. Please let us know your food preferences in the R.S.V.P. section.
We will provide some booze on the day, kegs of beer, cider and perhaps even the odd bottle of bubbly! But if you would like to bring other drinks, spirits and wine for example, please do! You can also buy alcohol on the campsite in their very well stocked shop.</p>

<h5>Party in the evening</h5>
<p>The party will start at about 7.00pm. The groom will, of course, be fitting in a DJ set along with a few of our talented friends!
We have to turn off the music at 11.00pm unfortunately, but the party doesn’t have to end… just the amplified music! So grab your guitar and bring it along…</p>
